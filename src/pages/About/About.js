      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        We realized that fixing a car was as simple as putting legos together. 
        So we made a site that shows you just how easy it is; saving you money, 
        time, and the hassle of dealing with overpriced mechanics. Our mission 
        is to bring car repairs to the home as efficiently as possible without 
        sacrificing the quality of mechanical repairs. Find the videos and parts 
        you need for the repair, or just check how much the mechanic will charge 
        to do it. Look for your car with the interactive vehicle maps to find any 
        repairs you need!
